# Ping Pong

#### _A classic exercise in branchinng and looping, with a retro skin!_

#### By _**Winter A. Runion**_

## Description
_The "ping pong" app is similar to the classic interview question Fizz Buzz. The user enters a number, and the app returns a list of numbers up to the number listed, with these exceptions:_ 

* **Spec**: Any number divisible by 3 should be replaced with the string, "ping!"
    * **Input**: "3"
    * **Output**: "0, 1, 2, ping!" 
* **Spec**: Any number divisible by 5 should be replaced with the string, "pong!"
    * **Input**: "5"
    * **Output**: "0, 1, 2, ping!, 4 pong!" 
* **Spec**: Any number divisible by 15 should be replaced with the string, "ping pong!"
    * **Input**: "15"
    * **Output**: "0, 1, 2, ping!, 4, pong!, ping!, 7, 8, ping!, pong!, 11, ping!, 13, 14, ping pong!" 

* **Spec**: The program returns a range of numbers from 0 to the users inputted number, and that output should be different each time the user enters a new number.
